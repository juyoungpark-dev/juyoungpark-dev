            <p>Learning and challenges are my passion.</p>
            <p>
              I had always dreamed to become a singer one day in my life. I love
              the feeling to be on stage. I love to express myself in creative
              ways. I love to inspire others.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day, I thought &nbsp;
              <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
                ‚ÄúThis is not enough for me.‚Äù
              </span>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Like everyone else, I had time to ponder what I wanted to do at
              some point of my life. That was when I fell in love with
              programming; I never imagined I would get close to technologies at
              all. One day, I was trying to figure out what Python is for some
              reason. And that was a whole new world. I realized that I am a
              more logical person with a handful of creativity.

              Writing a program is just like creating a piece of art. It is
              creative, artistic, and even practical. It does not disappear.
              Besides, did I tell you that my passion is learning and
              challenging myself? Programming is perfect for me in this aspect.
              It is very extensive that there is so much to learn. Learning
              never ends in programming. It allows me to keep motivated. Most
              importantly, seeing myself enjoying work not realizing it's
              already past the work hour!!! ü§ì
